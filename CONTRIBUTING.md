# Contributing to the Retailer Integration Guide

The Retailer Integration Guide uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted from the `gh-pages`
branch using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Install the [GitHub Pages Gem](https://github.com/github/pages-gem) to view the guide locally:

```bash
sudo gem install github-pages
```

Once the Gem has been installed you can `cd` to the directory containing the checked out
repository and run:

```bash
jekyll serve --base=""
```

Which will serve the guide at `http://localhost:4000`.
