## Upgrading from v3.\* to v4.0

We've changed our loan product makeup to provide additional products. Our
existing products become Flexible Finance and we've added Interest Free Credit
and Interest Bearing Credit. This has forced us to replace the Finance Actions
in the Merchant API to reflect the new data structure.

Upgrading to v4.0 provides the following benefits:

- non flexible finance products (inc. deposit)
- alternative fulfilment
- pre-population of applicant details
- improved order statuses
